I want to share a few reasons why I took up / took to poetry.

1. Total engrossment in the "[power of story](https://imran.yieldmore.org/power-of-story/)".

2. Encouragement in my student days, which [culminated in Amore in 2005](https://imran.yieldmore.org/amore/).

3. `Robin Williams` in Dead Poet's Society.

4. The `Tolkien` character Niggle (see below).

5. The second great love of my life who asked me, after seeing DPS - "Imran, what will YOUR verse be?"

6. Inspired by a #gentleman who wrote a book "The Future Poetry" unleashing all kinds of thoughts, especially the "Healing With Words" and [Spirit Element](https://imran.yieldmore.org/poems/for/msa/).

7. The "Brain Whisperer" who put me on a #creative path [nearly 15 years ago](https://imran.yieldmore.org/charter/), and the friend who introduced me to #audio #nootropics.

8. My #mother, the primary [#source of #art and #beauty](https://imran.yieldmore.org/power-of-art/) in my life.

9. The other #special girl in my life who took me in and #cared for me while my early, slow transition to #poet was happening in 2016/17.

10. The aunt and her friend who encouraged a #budding #artist, starving for #attention :)

Inspired by a `Tolkien` story about a painter Niggle and how his **art transformed the afterlife**.

Rhyme Scheme: Consecutive

[247 Niggle - 22 Sep 2020 - for Tolkien](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/works/leaf-by-niggle/)

```
There was a painter* led a renaissance from the fore
His work stood out and inspired like little did before
Fond he was of painting leaves to the minutest detail
Don't turn the pages eager to know how ends this tale

His heart was made of gold but he couldn't master time
I say again we need that skill to happily end the rhyme
Of life. A compelling rhyme with a rhythm that rings out
Makes us throw off our niggles and loudly want to shout

In his life on Earth he had a neighbor who had a garden
In the afterlife, they together built a veritable Eden
That parish served as a wonderful place for newcomers
To rejuvenate, passing time gaily in endless summers

Deep in the forest they found a rich crystal-clear spring
Believed it to nourish the land, cause birds to sing
Niggle's talent, par excellence, was a cut above the rest
The grandeur of his visions led him on many a quest

A time came when he started journeying about the land
Seeking mountains, he would bend and touch the sand
Laughing gaily at the restorative that is mother nature
With her soft and gentle hands that can heal any creature
