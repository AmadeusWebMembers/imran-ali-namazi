## Dawn

Today, 20th June 2025, we are [still] in the cusp of a new dawn. The **dawn of the Devas**, a dawn spanning centuries since the European period of enlightenment.

I deliberately say European to **test the open mindedness** of the [Overzealous (Indian) per this](https://imran.yieldmore.org/dear-indian/). <!--todo-->

And by Enlightenment period, I am referring to the **Vrekhem** book describing the **last 2 centuries with it's nightares**.

Let us imagine the **five-fold dream of a SEER gone** past, who spoke of the "resurgence and liberation of the peoples of Asia and her return to her great role in the progress of human civilization."

When he refers to Asia, he meant **Buddhist Asia, Islamized Asia, Christianized Asia, not to mention Judaic, Sikh and Jain Asia. Even Atheist Asia**.

Asia's gift is in **how we integrate, not infight**. But if we have progressed, then why such a torn, conflicted world? Hence the reference to a "centuries long dawning."

In another essay, [that same Seer clarifies](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/works/hour-of-god/section2-chapter3/):

"Out of imperfection we have to construct perfection, out of limitation to discover infinity, out of death to find immortality, out of grief to recover divine bliss, out of ignorance to rescue divine self- knowledge, out of matter to reveal Spirit. To work out this end for ourselves and for humanity is the object of our Yogic practice."

## Can We Draw Words Together?

What can mere mortals do against the hordes of dark forces, and those that profit by the reign of terror?

On the 19th of June, a Civil War is believed to have ended, but NOT the white man's burden, because, for the enthroning of good, Liberty's ear's are deaf, since we pray not to Her fervently enough to destroy the pulpits of  religious, political and financial mind control built upon the skulls of our forebears.

NOW FOR WRATH?
NOW FOR RUIN?
AND THE RED DAWN?

Battle brings out the worst in us, and it's only love that can prevail... Shhhh, dont use the word PEACE, our "Owners" would have us put down for saying it loud!

To my favourite Planeteer, I said

"the Kingdom can be manifest now,
If only people would listen to the voices inside
Where buried deep is the transcendent soul
And yet through it all, the sun does shine

As more people like you shine your truth on us.
9 years ago, I spoke of the loving movements
Than can transform our's to the Life Divine
Your's certainly is one such, so weave it well

Into the Fabric of this world, Her need is dire.
Enough of monarchs and fiefdoms which carve us,
Let's dance to Mother Earth's delight"

## Regroup and Make a Combined Stand!

All prejudice has to end, if we are to build a world of "nary a horror!"

So, I beg ask once more... IF, to those who want to act out of good feeling

"were given an instinct they trusted and maybe some inkling of the days to come, but only as in a dream, a promise of tomorrow, but one that had to be built. Rejoice they did in their work, those reunited brothers and sisters. For they trusted in the sense of vision of things to come, and fretted not at the travails ahead for they knew the strength of their numbers, the numbers of their Bright Ones, and the effulgence of their Mother."

What could we really do, how much more if we could truly work in unison? For the causes we espouse.

## True Union

Tomorrow, 21 Jun, we celebrate Yoga Day, the word derived from the Sanskrit Yuj meaning Union.

The Isha Upanishad says "it is you who have set the stars in their places and woven the necklace of the suns not with hands but by that Yoga.. ~ CWSA 17, p. 130"

To another seer was given the missive to spread Yoga, but some shores have no doors, other occupants are wary and still more agitated or bone weary.

But let's not go into the Divine Union between Man and God or Masculine and Feminine.

Let a new age of kindness stem from our hearts, that we may build a future of harmony.

[Since] "social media went out of hand, we've lost our humanity and its been all kinds of guerilla warfare and psychological tactics from every direction to kill our hearts and minds and destroy whole countries..."

"Come on Humanity, I DARE YOU TO BE BETTER! Stop making money and looking for personal peace... Marshall your forces and go liberate and empower the masses whose options are becoming less and less every day and who are more and more cannon fodder" in a global power play beyond mortal comprehension, unless you have read the Battle of Telegraph Road by Philip Pullman.

## Charting a New Course

When we speak of triumph, let it be with the words"Jagat Kula Ki Prem" (All Love to the World Family), for it is often forgotten that we were once one.

Planet, Earth, World, Pale Blue Dot, Home, whatever we call it, we simply hav to rout out the avidya (darkness / inconscience) from the minds of the people, but the war HAS been won, and people spontaneously CAN heal themselves with a little help as we establish inxh by inch, day by day, soul by soul, the Life Divine.

> Let us ever remember Thee.<br />
> Let us ever sing Thy glories.<br />
> Let Thy Name be ever on our lips.<br />
> Let us abide in Thee for ever and ever.<br />

In parting, I [leave you with this](https://imran.yieldmore.org/is-it-the-hour/).
