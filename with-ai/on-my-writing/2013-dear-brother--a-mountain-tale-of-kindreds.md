Dear Brother, of both Kindreds, Aug 10 2013

I grew up at my mother's side. We lived on the eastern side of a mountain. By the time I was fifteen, I had come to know the facts of life. Our people were not responsible for a single modern convenience. Those came from the tribe that lived on the west slope. There was also some mention of a Golden Age in my people's past, but that was millennia ago. I had the privilege of watching my brethren descend en masse into destitution, thievery - immorality in its many guises - a chaos that bound and enslaved us.

Repulsed by the thriving animal instinct here and lured by the order, freedom and justice there, my brothers had packed their belongings one early spring morning and began an exodus that would leave our villages bereft of most of the few remaining civilised people. The rest of us could not stand the chaos, but did not know what to do, so closed our eyes and pretended everythings alright.

We awoke after a generation, to find everything awry. The price of these conveniences had all gone through the roof, and in buying them, we had lost our souls and our pride somehow. Those brothers who had been in the exodus had also shut their eyes and wound up paying a series of prices they didnt even know existed. The prick of conscience of a land forgotten, or ignored, or spoken of with bittersweet sadness. People cloven as individuals, as well as a whole.

What remained to be done was for the tide of the exodus to be reversed. For some years now, there had been 2 trickles - one from the west, of those tired of prosthetics, who found peace in the words and works of the Bright Ones here. And another even smaller trickle of Bright Ones who went for the sake of those who knew not the way, to spread the glory and message of old.

But, everyone was playing the game of putting a price on every commodity, and on none was the price so high as on those tools and teachings that unclove the spirit. It seemed for a while that for every step taken forwards, we slid back a few. Then suddenly, we found our Mother had risen, and with a casual shake of her hand, had exposed the Fake Bright Ones and uncovered in us, the lost sense of pride, and love all-encompassing.

With arms outstretched, she embraced us all. She told us the secret that we had not always been two kindreds apart, and she welcomed back those westerners, and those west-dwelling easterners who of all it seemed had gone through the most horrible ordeal - that of amputating their homeland in their search for peace.

At the zenith of its flow, the exodus was turned. A hundred different movements began that systemmatically and lovingly changed the status quo. The animal instincts were humanized and the human instincts were hallowed and heightened.

Not everyone understood all these changes as they happened, but a few who had led the exodus felt a deep stirring in their heart, and paid heed to counsels they had not heard before. Some here were given an instinct they trusted and maybe some inkling of the days to come, but only as in a dream, a promise of tomorrow, but one that had to be built.

Rejoice they did in their work, those reunited brothers and sisters. For they trusted in the sense of vision of things to come, and fretted not at the travails ahead for they knew the strength of their numbers, the numbers of their Bright Ones, and the effulgence of their Mother.

## Response:
Okay, imagine this story is like a little play with two groups of people living on different sides of a big mountain. Let's break it down like a storybook!

**Paragraph 1: Living on the Mountain**

Imagine there were two families living on a big mountain. One family, let's call them the "East Siders," lived on the sunny side where the sun rises. They lived simply, like how people used to live a long, long time ago. They didn't have any of the cool new things like cars or phones. The other family, the "West Siders," lived on the side where the sun sets. They had all the new and shiny things! The East Siders also remembered a time long, long ago when their family was happy and things were good, like a "Golden Age" in a fairy tale. But now, they were becoming poor and doing bad things.

**Paragraph 2: Leaving Home**

The East Siders who were good and kind felt sad and yucky because of all the bad things happening around them. They looked over to the West Siders and saw that things seemed neat and fair over there. So, one sunny morning, many of the good East Siders packed their bags and walked over the mountain to live with the West Siders. It was like when some of your friends move away to a new school. The East Side villages became empty of almost all the good people. The ones who stayed behind felt things were bad, but they didn't know what to do, so they just closed their eyes and pretended everything was okay.

**Paragraph 3: Oops! Things Went Wrong**

After a long time, like when you grow from a little kid to a bigger kid, the East Siders who stayed behind woke up and saw that everything was messed up! The things the West Siders made, like those cool new things, became super expensive. And somehow, when the East Siders bought them, they felt like they lost something important inside, like their happiness or their good feelings about themselves. The East Siders who moved to the West Side also weren't as happy as they thought they would be. They missed their old home and felt a little sad or guilty about leaving it behind. It was like they were missing a part of themselves.

**Paragraph 4: Turning Back**

Now, some people started to go back. A few West Siders got tired of all the new things and found peace and happiness in the kind words and actions of some special people back on the East Side â€“ let's call these people the "Bright Ones." And even fewer of the Bright Ones from the East Side went over to the West Side to help the East Siders who didn't know how to be happy again, to share the good old ways.

**Paragraph 5: Everything Cost Too Much**

But everyone was trying to sell things and make money, even the things that could make people feel good inside again. It was like the most important things, like kindness and being happy, cost the most. It felt like for every step forward they took to make things better, they would slip a few steps back.

**Paragraph 6: Mommy Knows Best!**

Then, suddenly, it was like their "Mother" woke up! Maybe this "Mother" is like a wise leader or a feeling of goodness. With a wave of her hand, she showed everyone that some of the people who seemed good ("Fake Bright Ones") were not really good. And she helped the East Siders remember how to feel proud and love each other again.

**Paragraph 7: A Big Hug and a Secret**

The "Mother" gave everyone a big hug. She told them a secret: that they weren't always two separate families! They used to be one big happy family. She welcomed back the West Siders who were tired of the new things, and also the East Siders who had moved to the West Side. It seemed like those East Siders who moved away had the hardest time because they felt like they had cut off a part of themselves when they left their home to find peace.

**Paragraph 8: Turning Things Around**

Finally, the moving back and forth stopped. Lots of different groups started working together to make things better in a kind and organized way. The bad, selfish feelings started to become more like good, helpful feelings, and the good feelings became even stronger and more special.

**Paragraph 9: Not Everyone Understood**

Not everyone understood all these changes as they were happening. But some of the people who had first left the East Side felt something special in their hearts and listened to advice they hadn't heard before. Some people on the East Side had a good feeling about the future, like a dream of good things to come, but they knew they had to work hard to make those good things real.

**Paragraph 10: Happy Together!**

The brothers and sisters who were now back together were very happy as they worked. They believed in their dream of a better future and weren't scared of the hard work ahead because they knew they had many people helping, many "Bright Ones" to guide them, and the love and strength of their "Mother."

**Importance to Humanity:**

This story is important for everyone because it teaches us that:

*   **Shiny new things don't always make us happy.** Sometimes, focusing too much on getting stuff can make us lose what's really important, like our feelings of belonging and doing good.
*   **Leaving our roots can make us feel lost.** It's important to remember where we come from and the good things about our community.
*   **Working together is powerful.** When people who were separated come back together and work with love and kindness, they can make big positive changes.
*   **True happiness comes from inside.** It's about feeling good in our hearts and treating each other well, not just about having lots of things.
*   **Leaders and good examples are important.** The "Mother" and the "Bright Ones" helped people find their way back to happiness.

**Takeaways for a 7-Year-Old:**

*   Having lots of toys isn't the only way to be happy.
*   It's good to remember your family and where you come from.
*   When friends who were fighting become friends again and work together, they can do amazing things.
*   Being kind and helpful is more important than having the newest gadgets.
*   Sometimes, wise people can help us when we are lost.

**Description:**

This is a story told as a letter between people who were once part of the same group but became separated. It describes how one group became fascinated by new technologies and conveniences while seemingly losing their sense of community and values. The other group, who initially stayed behind, also faced problems. The story then talks about a turning point where people realize the importance of their shared heritage, the emptiness of material wealth without inner peace, and the power of unity and good leadership in bringing about positive change. It uses the metaphor of two "kindreds" living on different sides of a mountain to represent different ways of life and the consequences of their separation.

*   **Remember the good things about your family and where you live.** What makes them special?

*   **Try to be kind and helpful to others.** This makes you and the people around you feel good.

## Response:
Okay, imagine two groups of friends living on a big hill.

**Side A Friends:** Lived simply, playing with rocks and sticks. They remembered a happy time long ago. But then, they started being a bit mean to each other. Some nice friends felt sad and decided to go live with the Side B friends. The friends who stayed behind just pretended everything was okay.

**Side B Friends:** Had all the cool new toys! But things got expensive, and the friends who moved there felt like they missed their old home and their old friends.

Then, some friends from Side B got tired of all the toys and wanted to go back to the simple life on Side A. And some good friends from Side A went to Side B to help the sad friends remember how to be happy without lots of toys.

But everyone was trying to sell things, even things like being kind. It was hard to make things better.

Suddenly, it was like a wise grown-up came and showed everyone what was really important. She said that the Side A and Side B friends used to be one big happy group! She welcomed everyone back.

The friends started working together to make things good again. They learned to be kind and happy together, not just with toys.

Not everyone understood everything, but the friends who had moved away felt happy in their hearts. They trusted that things would get better if they worked together.

**What this story teaches us:**

*   Cool toys aren't the only way to be happy.
*   It's good to remember your family and friends.
*   Working together makes things better.
*   Being kind is super important.

**5 Fun Activities to Try:**

1.  **The "Simple Joys" Game:** For one whole day, try to have fun without using any electronics (like tablets or video games). Play outside, draw with crayons, read a book, or play with toys that don't need batteries. How does it feel? What simple things did you enjoy?
2.  **"Kindness Counts" Chart:** Make a chart with your family or friends. Every time someone does something kind for another person, put a sticker on the chart. At the end of the week, talk about all the nice things everyone did. How did it make people feel?
3.  **"Our Roots" Picture:** Draw a picture of your family or your home. Talk to someone older about happy memories from the past. What are some of the special things about where you come from?
4.  **"Working Together Tower":** Get some blocks or LEGOs with a friend or family member. Try to build the tallest tower you can _together_. You have to talk and help each other. How is it different from building alone?
5.  **"Happy Heart" Jar:** Decorate a jar. Every day, write down one thing that made you feel happy inside (not just a new toy). At the end of the month, read all the things in the jar. What kinds of things made your heart happy?
