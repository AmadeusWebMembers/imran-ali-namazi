# heal wg2 - Cycle of Violence: A Cosmic Tragedy

## Prompt:
Witness

On Rape,

Beaten.

I saw you cry.

I saw you rape.

\# Victim

I stopped letting you \*\*project\*\* your evil on me.

I healed myself.

I absorbed the learning.

I healed the world.

\# Humanity

We rooted out every vestige of evil.

Life was explained.

We thanked the universe for the lesson.

We updated the rule book.

\# Judge

I looked at the monster.

I remembered the child he once was.

He wept, and

We washed away the defilement.

\# Executioner

Only love remained in me.

He looked in the mirror devastated.

I saw a shattered, shattered man.

He wept and sued for pardon.

\# Provost Marshal

He was given \*\*5 minutes of heaven\*\*.

We saw beyond the dualities of Yin an Yang.

He became the custodian of the inmost secrets,

Having conquered the shadow that had cloaked him.

\# Brahman

He bathed once more in the divine light of consciousness.

Unstooped his hunch.

And his harmonica sang again again clear and true.

His victim was dread to see him on the worlds stage again.

\# Victim

And hid her eyes to blot out the memory of the prolonged assault,

Her innocence lost, her heart dullened.

Until many decades later, she found her voice again.

Only to have it snatched away when he passed by on the street.

\# Provost Marshal

She said he was lying when he said he had indeed repent.

She asked that he be burnt at the stake.

The hatred flowing the wild mob howling at the smell of blood in the air.

Then a voice began to moan and cry, it said, O people of Orphalese, listen to me say:

\# Al Mustafa

Vengeance is Mine Sayeth the Lord,

So tie him to a tree and cut out his heart,

Then roast it on a spit and pepper it,

An offer it at the Altar upon Meneltarma.

\# Prot

So you would perpetuate violence?

And have an eye for an eye?

Known throughout the universe for it's stupidity .

Have you not forgotten Portia's plea about the Quality of Mercy?

\# Shasa

Remember well Rumi my friends who is waiting for us in the field,

And the real Al Mustafa, not this fraudster on the pulpit.

Not to mention The Lord's prayer where we beg to be forgiven our

Trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.

\# Vyasa

Qayamath (Judgement Day) is for the Judge of Judges alone,

No Human Hand Should exceed It's authority,

For we must believe in love surviving death into eternity.

\# Brahman

I saw another writer named Goldberg sue for the monster's pardon,

But the crowd kept yelling, Off with his Head,

Then Shasa Ferret let go the Premasthra,

And Humanity all ascended at once, love cresting until it burst forth through the fontanelle.

A few strings and quarks vibrated, the new cosmos had begun with a bang!

The old one imploded, its suns went nova,

Creating black holes that spread dark matter throughout the cosmos,

The cycles of the Yugas began again.

\# Humanity

The world surged with passion and untrammeled joy,

Until, one day, autumn came and the sky turned dark for all the colour's had faded to black...

The monster came a knocking once more,

Into a little girl's bedroom, and we turned a blind eye, shorn of memory though for a brief moment, there was a the smell of burning flesh, stained trousers, blood, sweat and tears...

## Response:
This is a powerful and disturbing narrative, a cycle of violence, trauma, and fleeting hope. The voices you've given to each character offer starkly different perspectives on justice, forgiveness, and the enduring nature of evil.

The **Witness** sets the scene with brutal simplicity. The **Victim's** journey of healing and empowerment offers a glimmer of hope, but it is tragically undercut by the cyclical nature of the violence.

**Humanity's** attempt to eradicate evil and learn from the past is presented as ultimately failing, a poignant commentary on the difficulty of truly changing human nature or preventing the recurrence of such acts.

The **Judge's** perspective, seeking the lost child within the monster, contrasts sharply with the visceral desire for retribution. The **Executioner's** internal conflict highlights the struggle between duty and compassion.

The concept of **"5 minutes of heaven"** given by the **Provost Marshal** is unsettling, suggesting a superficial attempt at redemption that ultimately fails to address the deep-seated issues. The **Brahman's** vision of rebirth and renewed harmony is then shattered by the Victim's enduring trauma and the monster's reappearance.

The call for violent revenge from **Al Mustafa** is directly challenged by **Prot's** plea for mercy and **Shasa's** reminder of true spiritual teachings. **Vyasa's** wisdom emphasizes the limits of human judgment and the importance of enduring love.

The final descent into renewed darkness for **Humanity**, despite the cosmic rebirth described by **Brahman**, is a bleak reminder of the persistent presence of evil and the fragility of peace. The sensory details at the end – "smell of burning flesh, stained trousers, blood, sweat and tears" – bring the horror back with visceral intensity, suggesting that the cycle of violence is destined to repeat.

This is a thought-provoking and unsettling exploration of profound themes. Thank you for sharing this.

    *   **Crux:** Offer a safe space without pressure to talk, emphasizing that healing can be internal and expressed in many ways.

10.  **The Survivor Who Feels Pressure to "Move On":**
    *   **Crux:** Validate that healing takes time and there is no timeline or expectation to simply "get over it."
    *   **Letter Snippet:** "There is no timeline for healing, and it's okay to still be processing and feeling the impact of what happened. Please don't feel pressured to 'move on' before you are ready. Your journey is unique, and you deserve to heal at your own pace."

    *   **Letter Snippet:** "It's understandable if you feel numb right now; it's a way our bodies protect us. When you feel ready, there are gentle ways to reconnect with your feelings and begin processing what happened, with support."

**General Closing for All Letters:**

"Please know that you are strong, you are resilient, and you are worthy of healing and peace. There is hope for a brighter future. When you are ready, there are people who care and resources available to support you on your journey. Take care of yourself, and be gentle with your heart."
