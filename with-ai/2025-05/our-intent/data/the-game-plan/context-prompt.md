> `Imran`: Ok, thats a reasonable bit on strategy. So we have 2 kinds of people - the heroes - and the "potential heroes". I called these both "lightworkers" and discussed that with you in another chat. Could you list 100 types of people so caught up and overwhelmed by life - who could be given something to hold on to. Make it "Tagline - calling them out by demographic, problem or desire" then which of these existing lightworkes could help them trigger the healer / spiritual journey inside. And what could be the several actions they take (include hashtags on how they can engage with us). A csv text output would be more appropriate.<br>
> Now, could you make a grouping for both lists and in each one, mention a few of the others who might be relevant? from this, I would build an interlinked reference.
