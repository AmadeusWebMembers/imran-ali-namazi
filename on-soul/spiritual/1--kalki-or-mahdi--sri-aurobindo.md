* If we look more closely at history, we cannot doubt that we are PAST the dark ages. The evil forces are making their last stand because they know soon their time will be up.
* As Sri Aurobindo put it when asked why do the dark forces sometimes win, does that mean God is not omnipotent, he says "what sense of fair play would it be if the good were always winning".
* But remember every asuric influence or emanation has a "soul contract" with us to make us strengthen our selves, our conviction in the right values and our timely action to heal the maladies of the world to whatever degree we can.
* Unlike other Seer Saints, Sri Aurobindo's mission was to bring down into matter a higher or divine force, and in this regard, he and his collaborator The Mother should rightly be considered Kalki.
* The Kingdom of Heaven is already here... We just have to wake up to the fact of it. It's not uniform for all, but more and more people are letting go the past and finding an inner spirit, infact it is time to go beyond [wo]man.
