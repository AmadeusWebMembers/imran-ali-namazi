1. Will the #forerunners of the new #humanity, Shasa and Alla be baptised in [this wellspring of life](https://enterprise.wikimedia.com/)?
1. And when will the #rock #arenas open and [humanity band together](https://imran.yieldmore.org/charter/)? - 2015
1. When will the [change agents unite](https://imran.yieldmore.org/catalyst/)? - 2020
1. When will we go [back to our roots](https://imran.yieldmore.org/dear-brother/) and realise the One in all? And do our #Effulgent #Mother and #Cosmic #Father proud - 2013
1. I say this with CERTAINTY, that [HARMONY - 2022](https://imran.yieldmore.org/on-harmony/) shall prevail and the #evil forces will no longer hold sway, rather, we will have [life and spirituality explained](https://www.lifeexplained.com/).
1. Rest in #peace #JohnLennon, some of us DID #imagine all the #world, living life in #peace
1. We ARE becoming a [world beyond human](https://beyondman.org/New-Spirituality.php)
1. and..... the #colloquy at #kurukshetra will YET [liberate us all from thralldom](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/works/essays-on-the-gita/) - 2012
1. A new spirit has [already taken hold](https://ideas.yieldmore.org/wisdom/spirit/) - 2015

So liberate us, Oh #Kalki, the double poled #avatar, who's #Potential went behind the veil on Dec 5th 1950, bringing the #divine down into #matter several years later as achieved by the #Kinetic.

let us rejoice in our [new found divinity](https://imran.yieldmore.org/divine/] - 2015

As the ripened cucumber (with the intervention of the gardener) is freed from its bondage (to the creeper), may He liberate us from death for the sake of immortality.

During a period of nearly fifty years, `Sri Aurobindo` created what is probably the greatest epic in the English language - I venture the judgment that it is the "most comprehensive, integrated, beautiful and perfect cosmic poem ever composed".

Om, (May there be) Peace, Peace, Peace (at the the three levels - Adidaivika, Adibhautika and Adhyatmika).

In #SriAurobindo and #TheMother - #MirraAlfassa we trust...

And follow the ideal of human unity
