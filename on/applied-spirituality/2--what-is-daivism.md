In the Bhagavad-Gita, we have mention of a Dharmakshetre - a field where warriors contend to work out and find their Dharma or way of life.

We can leave it to scholars, teachers and intellectuals to figure out if we are "circling the drain" (heading towards an Armageddon or Pralaya) or being guided back to the light.

I believe what I (perhaps you too) need is to give the "current moment" our utmost attention, perhaps even "fill the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run".

And if we do this with the LOVE our saints, leaders, seers, acharyas and teachers BORE and BROUGHT us, then we can indeed establish a Kingdom on Earth - not the destruction the doomsayers prattle about.

I'm not saying the Kingdom is here yet, [nor the way easy](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/works/hour-of-god/section1-chapter2/), but perhaps a "council of lightworkers" or heroes (not fantasy fiction - but real life embodied ones) can spontaneously arise everywhere, take strength in their numbers and with the effulgence of their saints and divine leaders and cosmic forces, establish a "Daivic Cycle," like the Forerunners who predicted and laid the foundations for a Divine Materialization and Terrestrial Transformation.

Daiva and Dieu both meaning "Divine" which can happen only to the true pacifist and lightworker on a field with a different name - a "premakshetre" or a field of loveâ€¦ and of love making (yes we are referring to the bedroom where violence and discord are rife).

Technology is already being used to destroy cultures, and I'm not sure I believe in virtual spiritual pilgrimages, but I trust in the process of the Divine Plan unfolding and maybe that's just a way to keep the masses out of mischief until they [**awaken the silent builder within**](https://imran.yieldmore.org/teeming-with-life/). I will pause now and let you read that link - the ultimate goal of the archetypal hero who brings, not a "digital" transformation but a Spiritual one. To apply for that role, please [email us](mailto:team@aurrrah.com?subject=Daivic+Cycle+Interest) here.

Time for the masses to reject the gross and [false bright ones](https://imran.yieldmore.org/dear-brother/), who are often victims of their side clutches of attainment or who feed into the ego trip of having devotees.

I was lucky to study in Chinmaya Mission, and another cosmopolitan school both of whom said the "divinity" is within, or to put it in the words of Khalil Gibran, "is not religion all thoughts and deeds?" Even luckier to have that same message echoed in India, the land of my birth, my family who were brought up in a time where everyone embraced, accepted and celebrated all "faiths", and the books that found their way to my wisdom hungry hands.

If Allah has sent his prophets to every land and time, then must we not admit that each people and culture have had Shamans / Spiritualists who have been custodians of the Eternal Wisdoms.

Or to put it in Tim Rice's words "If every tongue was stilled, the noise would still continue - the rocks and stones themselves would start to sing.

So sing on folks, sing a song of Freedom - Freedom from the horrors and Hangovers of the Dark Ages and let's walk into the unsullied light

All Love to the World Family
