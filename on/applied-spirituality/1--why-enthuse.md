"Indian religion has always felt that since the minds, the temperaments and the intellectual affinities of men are unlimited in their variety, a perfect liberty of thought and of worship must be allowed to the individual in his approach to the Infinite." - [Sri Aurobindo](https://archives.yieldmore.org/sri-aurobindo/).

This is why we need more of dialogue and acceptance. It was [only yesterday](https://g.co/kgs/RtmGv1s) (1893) we had a world parliament of religions, a [league of nations](https://archives.yieldmore.org/unity-postscript-1949/), a United Nations.

I believe, with the work of Simon and the Good Country project, even the word Nation is to one day (soon) become obsolete. The idea was for countries to work **with** each other on common burning issues and ultimately coalesce into one world, [one planet - one people please](https://g.co/kgs/zjQGUgq)!

Again, in the words of [Sri Aurobindo](https://archives.yieldmore.org/india/), our ultimate aim should be "a step in evolution which would raise humankind to a higher and larger consciousness".

So can we establish a [common planet](https://common-planet.org/)? A thousand times yes! How? With [LOVE](https://g.co/kgs/wGbvrvr) ðŸ¥° and careful nurturing.

We need a [New Spirituality](https://beyondman.org/New-Spirituality.php) to take hold, remembering [the 4 aids](https://archives.yieldmore.org/aids-of-the-overman/) of those who would stay true to the cause of lifting up humanity, understanding [global patterns](https://beyondman.org/Patterns-of-the-Present.php), and the Interconnectedness of it all.

However, the most part of humanity still holds on to one or several schools of thought / worship, but we ARE ALL heading towards pluralism and harmony, hence these immortal words of GB Shaw jump out to knock us with fresh perspective.

He says - "Religion is a great force â€” the only real motive force in the world; but what you fellows don't understand is that you must get at a man through his own religion and not through yours."

On this, the 8th Feb 2025, I, Imran, begin a new chapter which proclaims boldly to the world that we must Enthuse about God - [ENTHEOS](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/topics/religion/) - if we are to live in true [Spiritual Democracy](https://youtu.be/cVOE1CHVtjI?si=BwsZBlJZpjUc5POs).

"Perfection has to be worked out, harmony has to be accomplished" â€¦ "out of ignorance to rescue divine self- knowledge, out of matter to reveal Spirit. To work out this end for ourselves and for humanity is the object of our Yogic practice." ~ [Hour of God](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/works/hour-of-god/section2-chapter3/).

Ultimately, it is about allowing each other the freedoms to choose their own path, of if we are in a position to offer perspectives, show them the beauty and variety of differing [paths](https://ulc.org/).

There is a way out of hell, but we must reach for the [Divine](https://imran.yieldmore.org/divine/), that Flame Imperishable within us all.

So many wordsâ€¦ I suppose it's time to go [marry the ideas with action](https://www.ted.com/talks/mel_robbins_how_to_stop_screwing_yourself_over). And for inspiring / allowing me to act, I must thank those around me who recognise the "Sadhana" we all have undertaken, for the establishing of a Life Divine.

It's time to start an [Institute for the Development of Effective Applications of Spirituality](https://ideas.yieldmore.org/wisdom/spirit/)â€¦ So shall it be written, so shall it be done.
