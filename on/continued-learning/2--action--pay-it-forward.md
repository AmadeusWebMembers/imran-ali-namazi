## What is Project ARYA

Standing for "Awareness Resulting in Your Action", ARYA was in 2021, intended as a [youth led](%url%sophia/) social causes advocacy initiative where a team of students learn the skills needed to support a charity of their choice.

Today, we include [professionals / volunteers](%url%trainers/) AND students (after being trained) to help out.

## Empowering Change Makers (Pillars and Charities)

I'm Imran, [a technologist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianamazi/) trying to put my skills at the disposal of youngsters and society.

We want to work in collaboration with each other and build and online network together, sharing learnings, resources and professionals / volunteers / interns.

I have [devised a system](https://amadeusweb.com/) that quickly builds a website for businesses, charities and students, all of which can be on the YM / JE network.

Charges are nominal and negotiable as this is our first year of active operation.

If you choose to do a complete revamp of your website for all the [reasons mentioned here](https://amadeusweb.com/why-us/), charges would be:

* 20k for development and work until go-live.
* training, banner design and content loading extra at Rs 500 / 750 per hour.
* 3.5k for hosting from the 2nd year, platform fees waived.
