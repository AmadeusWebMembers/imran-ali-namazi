Since 2008, I have held 5 jobs, each in a challenging area and doing much for code quality, tech mentoring and the building of framework / infrastructure code.

With a few breaks in between to pursue my creative and ideative ambitions, you can fast forward to 2022 when I left my last full time IT job. I still wish to enter the "IT coaching space" but for now am pursuing other things.

I do still build websites as a part of what I offer to people, but all this is in Amadeus - a platform of mine that evolved with time.
