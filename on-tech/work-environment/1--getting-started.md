<!--ENGAGE-->

I had a good run in my corporate career. Now in 2025 I am "at beginnings" ready to scratch build projects and service verticals and teams. I see some advantages of not playing by the rules.

## Planting the Seed

* **Start from nothing** - this shows us how resourceful we can be, lets us define the playbook and the "values and work ethic" and decide who we want to work with - clients. team members and others (vendors, donees etc).
* **Look for serious staff** - given a bit of time, can they write their own "terms of engagement" / NDA / Non Compete and also the Profit Sharing model - I prefer these being part of the discussion prior to long term working together.
* **Build close-knit teams** - keep it small and friendly. Talk about the kinds of projects that wont conflict with your interests or taboos. Think of bifurcating when reaching a predefined set of goals.
* **How much is enough** - the metrics will lure you until you are obsessed with them, ask what profits you want, what hours, what lifestyle, what timings and stress for everyone, what to do with surplus, leave and self care policies, emergency funds, social giveback.
* **Investors or not** - again, depending on the culture and goals - do you want investors breathing down your neck?

## Work Culture

* **Talk about the how** - the process, the aesthetic, the way you interact with the customer, the dedication to detail, the technology, fun fridays, the holidays for bonding / the movie nights at office... think it all through.
* **Following the crowd** - can we extend / create our own way of working? Frameworkism? App / Social media craze? Pursuit of figures? For instance, is there a simpler web4 forming instead of this web3 band wagon.
* **Is everyonne heard** - in all 3 directions, listening is key. Are the ones at the top not opening communication channels / do we not listen to our peers or team leads.
* **Fitment and passion** - if you really want to build something to last, people are the most important ingredient - picking, engaging and keeping them. Trial tasks, head to head discussions, ability to share wisdom in groups and have heart to heart conversations are all critical for this. Agree to part ways after "probation" if need be, especially if the expectation on passion is not met or there's a sense of politics.
* **Team dynamics** - needs to be built synapse by synapse - hoping we are creating a superbrain - with both functional and aesthetic.

## As We Mature

* **Wisdom's learned** - yes people are going to leave - is the process, daily sharing and documentation effort good enough to withstand that?
* **Conflict on IPs developed** - are they leaving with any IP - did we let them bring it up pre probation completion and make a mutually agreeable NDA / fair use? I've seen this line violated both ways...
* **Goalsetting and Mutual Growth** - how mature are we all? Do we want "workers" or "creative collaborators".
* **Reward structure** - this can vary, perhaps best taken as a poll, discussed by key leads then put to "town hall" discussion.
* **Process that facilitates** - if everone knows the actual goals and can see the project, task and role aligning with the individual's development, then there is a healthy process.
