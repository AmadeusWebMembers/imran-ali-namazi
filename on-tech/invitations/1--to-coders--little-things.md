Dear Fresher or Coding Junior

There is a trend towards simplicity, something I have been working towards with amw, a microframework whose core is a few hundred kbs, and requires only 1 copy per development machine / server making impact analysis, smoke testing and deployments easier.

It's a file based customizable (menu structure / content architecture) system where code, data, snippets and content all go into the same "site" folder / Git repository.

Please check html-first.com and tell me what you think about frameworkism and why file based is better or worse than db based.

A true tech lead should evaluate each project without prior golden hammer bias.

If you like the concept of html first / web components, please try recreating this - developing your own data structure for it.

Use AI - github copilot - if needed and showcase it on a service like codepen.

Educate yourself on #design principles, development habits and #business proces (a collection of usecases)

With this post, I am starting a #timeboxed free #mentoring service where I will coach you upto 2 hours a week for 4 weeks, provided you are diligent, come with a desire to learn and ready to push the thought process to the limit.

I will encourage you to start your own #brand and #reciprocate my time by spending your time on tasks which build my various ideas and projects.

Also, by the time you earn your wings, you will strike similar deal with next batch, and asked to plan and grow to add upto 20 members to your brand within 3 years.

All of us following certain team dynamics and supporting one another.
