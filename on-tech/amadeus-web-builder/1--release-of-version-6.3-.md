Howdy Amigos and Amiguettes,

A new version of #amadeusweb is being built. v6.3

I've separated the framework from the website content which is at preview.amadeusweb.com.

Some of the new features are the "code" flavours where a lot of a typical website's backend work can be moved to the framework. We now support the default and 2 more exclusively for authors.

A showcase page will be readied in good time, but the important part is not the glossy coating on the exterior, but a rich tapestry of webmaestro experience at the kernel.

You can see all projects of mine here (even the pre amadeus ones). code.amadeusweb.com

The framework here bitbucket.org/amadeusweb/amadeus/

And the new main site here bitbucket.org/amadeusweb/www/

A framework that let's you configure the menu structure, asks which file is to be used and renders the theme's header and footer around it.

Back and forth framework, modules, site, flavour and theme - all about 50 php files are woven to render a page in less than a 10th of a second, uses about 1.2mb and is set to run a large network of websites (single copy of the builder, theme and code flavour).

I cannot but say its the exact opposite of the even more complex systems out there who put tech and UI over everything. An old mentor said bells and whistles last.

We take a different approach - we put the website owner and their team in the front seat, driving the content and making small adjustments to the site or framework as the need arises.

Ask for a #demo and keep an open mind. We offer training to make content changes directly and think WAAY beyond just a simple one time attractive single page but a long term content and feature enhancement roadmap.

We also bring social media content into the website using a sheet so the 2 can reference each other.

And an assistant feature that prepares a table of contents (of each box) and reads it out using the browser's default text to speech engine.

A new special folders and special features module is being developed which will handle

* wikis (sheet driven),
* blurbs (floating links by category and popup)
* rich pages (per the ui elements defined in the current theme)
* decks (uses reveal js)
* tables (feeds json or sheet data into datatables.net)
* gallery of images

Special importance to tabular data (tsv files) makes it easy for seo, rich pages, donation targets and amounts and any custom code.

Using the now "writer with works" flavour, I was able to build a whole taxonomy around my simple work > has collection > has piece way of authoring, which can be seen in action at imran.yieldmore.org and is driven by a single "sitemap" sheet.

Another interesting feature is the "composite work" which let's you build an entire book or resource section from a single text file and even print to PDF. This is not yet online.

Another task at hand is to make a calendar (panchaang).

Back with more as thoughts and features develop.

Hope you are also excited and drop me a line.

Or contact for a demo.

Warmly,
Imran Ali Namazi
