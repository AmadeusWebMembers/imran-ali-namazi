## Notes

Please make a note of these:

* Remember how it felt to be a student and prepare to help train the next batch / document your journey online if you want to become a SME / influencer. Here, your diligence in capturing your learning process will be important.

* Each student will require to [serve an NGO](%url%arya/) for at least a month, so start planning who and how in your first week itself.

* An Evolving Goal Toolkit is listed out for you in [our brochure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FdCB29Wgom-z5EXjTQ5kCnykkv5Ig9zMCMJHi6Dp814/edit?usp=sharing). You can work on this both from a laptop as well as a phone (using your personal gmail account)

* After every session record a video recap and be ready to make a youtube and blog post out of it.

* Setup Amadeus at learn.yieldmore.org/group/your-social-handle/ remember this can be bilingual. If you are unsure about using this tool, you can use Google Sites.

* Don't worry about your current level of writing, speaking or presenting, this will improve over time.

* From your life vision and career choices, make a detailed list of skills.

* Always explore options and don't be reluctant to get into the details. Work isn't always what we want so allow for that.

* Technical skills are the easiest. Culture, mental strength, character and a strong civic sense take longer to build.

* Be aware of the challenges humanity is facing and try to find ways to alleviate that.

* Have an all rounder attitude to learning and steadily improve and expand your skills.

* We are all here to learn and grow together so don't feel shy.

* Guides are only there to paint the big picture, it's up to you to try, get into the details and make decisions.

* We are here to support you lifelong, so keep in touch and come back if you need anything.
